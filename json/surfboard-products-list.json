        "describe": "78’ WORLD CHAMPION MODEL WAYNE \" RABBIT \" BARTHOLOMEW LIMITED COLLECTORS EDITION ONLY 10 x BOARDS MADE.“Old Faithful standing the test of time”.When I came back from Hawaii in November 1972 and met Gill Glover, I began riding his board made at Hohensee in January 1973 for my first foray into the Opens, winning the first round of the Qld Titles at Burleigh vs PT, MP, and Keith Paull. Gill and I started refining the Bugs squash tail in 1973, winning the 73, 74 & 76 Queensland Title before taking on the World Tour in 77 and coming 2nd to Shaun Tomson for the Title.So, it was already proven against the world’s best, and it all came together in 78, shaped by Gill and glassed by Hot Stuff owner Paul Hallas. Subsequently it was christened Old Faithful for the all-round high performance in diverse waves and all types of conditions.The squash tail back corners provided great hold in hollow barrels, as I had been working towards taking the classic Queensland cutback to the next level, having been heavily influenced by Peter Drouyn and Michael Peterson. It had all come together in readiness to take on my new rivals Shaun Tomson, Mark Richards, Michael Ho and Cheyne Horan and win the 1978 world title.I rode “Old Faithful” exclusively until I started getting boards as well from Al Byrne, deep six channels at Hot Stuff plus Bob Hurley twin fins, both in 81 until Simon’s thruster eclipsed the single fin.DESIGNED & SHAPED BY GILL GLOVER, FINISHED BY HOT STUFF SURFBOARDS"

        "describe": "Perfect for knee to head high waves.EPS Epoxy construction - lighter and more buoyant than traditional Polyurethane.Pretty standard fish outline with its wide point forward and bulk of its volume under the chest, where most of your body weight is. Buoyancy under the chest translates to easier paddling, more waves and ultimately progressing faster.Wide tail is inherently buoyant which translates into speed and forward drive when pushed against.Single to double concave; single concave through front creates lift and speed,merging into a double concave through the fins which breaks the water and allows the board to roll rail-to-rail (like a seesaw).5-Fin setup offers maximum versatility;Thruster gives ultimate predictability and consistency.Swap out to a Quad if you like it fast and loose.Wide, low-rockered boards with plenty of concave such as this one are highly versatile, working equally well for beginners in larger sizes as they do for confident surfers in smaller sizes.Fish shapes have long been a go-to for beginner-intermediate boards due to their tendency for easy speed in small waves as well as stability and manoeuvrability.Fairly low (flat) rocker helps to maintain speed through flat sections of the wave and also give the board a larger sweet spot regarding footing position; both major pain points for learners."
